# EduHub Favicon
# This is a simple base64-encoded 16x16 pixel favicon
# If you need a proper .ico file, you can use an online converter

# For now, we're using an SVG-based favicon served via Remix route
# The favicon route is at: /favicon.ico

# To create a proper favicon.ico file:
# 1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
# 2. Upload the favicon.svg file from the public directory
# 3. Download and replace this file with the generated favicon.ico

# The current setup serves an SVG favicon which works in modern browsers
