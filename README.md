## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (for database)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Edu
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` with your Supabase credentials:
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

4. Start the development server:
```bash
